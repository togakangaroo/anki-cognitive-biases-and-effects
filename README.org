Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning. Also known as current moment bias or present bias, and related to Dynamic inconsistency. A good example of this is a study showed that when making food choices for the coming week, 74% of participants chose fruit, whereas when the food choice was for the current day, 70% chose chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For example, in one study subjects assigned the same probability to the likelihood of obtaining a mean height of above six feet [183 cm] in samples of 10, 100, and 1,000 men. In other words, variation is more likely in smaller samples, but people may not expect this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Leveling is when people keep out parts of stories and try to tone those stories down so that some parts are excluded. Therefore, it makes it easier to fill in the memory gaps that exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

* Setup and run Anki Generator
  
  First set up the virtual environment by running the following shell command. I use =pyenv=, but if you have =pipenv= in the global python environment, you don't need the prefix
  
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :dir ./generator :results silent
    (async-shell-command "pyenv exec pipenv install")
  #+end_src

  Ok so then run it I guess 

  #+begin_src shell :dir ./generator 
    pyenv exec pipenv run python generate_anki_from_org.py
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Wrote 119002 bytes to cognitive_biases.apkg


  Opening that up with anki

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
    (async-shell-command "anki ./generator/cognitive_biases.apkg")
  #+end_src


  And that actually works! Yay.

  Next to work on cleanup
