An [[id:e4001525-d16c-4632-afc9-0813bf574b4b][Anki]] deck to memorize information about cognitive bias

* Plan
Due to my [[id:a3af9090-a8e6-4e7a-9d49-a26d9d220c97][Tech Terms]] Project I should already have the code to go from an org table to an Anki Deck

So where is going to be our data source?

- There is [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg?ref=insanelyusefulwebsites&utm_source=pocket_mylist][this great svg file]]
- But [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases][this wikipedia list looks even better]]

I guess you can actually pull that second one into a buffer and then use [[https://github.com/AdamNiederer/elquery][elquery]] within [[id:3cf50942-d434-4726-b56b-7749839090d7][Emacs]]. 

Though actually maybe even you can do it with [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html][tree-sitter]]

* Playground

  First lets try to open up a buffer and load it with that html
  
  This is interesting, but it results in just the text of the page layed out visually, not html...which is a rather interesting ability
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (eww-browse-url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases")
  (html-mode)
  (rename-buffer "*Cognitive Biases*")
#+end_src


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (require 'request)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Cognitive Bias*")
    (->> (request "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases"
           :sync 't)
         request-response-data
         insert)
    (html-mode))
#+end_src

That's not bad, but tree-sitter just looks like stuff like this

#+begin_quote
        self_closing_tag:
          tag_name:
          attribute:
            attribute_name:
            quoted_attribute_value:
              attribute_value:
          attribute:
            attribute_name:
            quoted_attribute_value:
              attribute_value:
#+end_quote

That can still totally be filtered but surely something else is better

And looks like elquery would even skip that and just let us fetch a parsed three from a url

So how do we do this with that?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'elquery)
  (->> (elquery-read-buffer "*Cognitive Bias*")
       (elquery-$ "h3")
       (nth 15)
       elquery-full-text)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Availability heuristic[edit]

Ok so working off of html is going to suck. There's [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Get_the_contents_of_a_page][some apis available though]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (require 'request)
  
  (iter-defun gim/cognitive-bias-deck/parse ()
    "Parse the current buffer and generate tree of nodes. Returns an iterator."
    (while (not (eobp))
      (forward-line)))
  
  
  
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Cognitive Bias*")
    (erase-buffer)
    (mediawiki-mode)
    (let ((wikitext (->> (request "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=parse&page=List_of_cognitive_biases&prop=wikitext&formatversion=2&format=json"
                           :sync 't)
                         request-response-data
                         json-parse-string
                         (gethash "parse")
                         (gethash "wikitext"))))
      (insert wikitext)

* Cognitive Biases Table
  
Ok, so now I've spent some time really figuring this out and learned just...so much on the way. The following is going to pull down the Cognitive Biases mediawiki using the wikipedia api, then parse a temporary buffer document, clean up the data, and put in a 2d list format that works well with org table rendering

| Hyperbolic discounting         | where discounting is the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs. Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning.<ref name="Laibson1997QJE">{{cite journal /author-link=David Laibson /last=Laibson /first=David / name-list-style = vanc/year=1997 /title=Golden Eggs and Hyperbolic Discounting /journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] /volume=112 /issue=2 /pages=443–477 /doi=10.1162/003355397555253/citeseerx=10.1.1.337.3544 }}</ref> Also known as current moment bias or present bias, and related to [[Dynamic inconsistency]].

For example, "I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads."<ref>{{Cite news/url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp/title=Gambler's Fallacy/Monte Carlo Fallacy / author = Investopedia Staff /date=2006-10-29/work=Investopedia/access-date=2018-10-10/language=en-US}}</ref>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This needs to still be claned up further but this is honestly pretty good for the average quality of anki decks. I would like to just prove that this process even works so thats up next

What I want to be doing here now is running through the same process [[https://github.com/togakangaroo/tech-terms][I used here]].

I was going to just go ahead and export these to a document using tangling but the actual results aren't actually org-table formatted. They are lisp code. So I think we need to actually script this

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (save-excursion
    (org-babel-goto-named-result "cognitive-biases-table")
    (forward-line)
    (write-region (point) (org-babel-result-end) "./biases.org"))
#+end_src

Well that was surprisingly easy

* Cognitive Biases Table From Svg
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args:js: :cmd "npm exec --package=puppeteer -- node" :results output :prologue "module.paths.push(...process.env.PATH.split(':').filter(p => p.includes('/_npx/')).map(p=> p.replaceAll(/\\/\\.bin/g, '')))\n!(async () => {\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer')\n" :epilogue "})().then(r => r && console.log(r), e => console.log(`ERROR`, e))"
  :header-args: :noweb strip-export
  :END:

  That page actually has fewer biases than the svg. Lets try parsing a table from there instead. Emacs isn't super great at parsing svg so lets automate it with Puppeteer
  
  #+name: cognitive-biases-table-from-svg-js
  #+begin_src js :cache yes
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
    try {
        const page = await browser.newPage()
        await page.goto('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg?ref=insanelyusefulwebsites&utm_source=pocket_mylist');
        const biases = await page.evaluate(() => {
            const anchors = [...document.querySelectorAll('a')]
            const biases = anchors.map(el => [ 
                 el.querySelector('switch>*:last-child').textContent,
                 el.href.baseVal,
            ])
            return biases
        })
        console.log(JSON.stringify(biases))
    } catch ( err ) {
        console.log(err)
    } finally {
        await browser.close();
    }
  #+end_src

  Ok, so now I think some macros would be helpful - just the ability to combine lambdas with threading like in Racket. I use this pattern all the time so for now lets just put it top level in my personal namespace.

  #+name gim/lambda-threading-macros
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
    (defmacro gim/-lambda>> (&rest body)
      `(lambda (it) (->> it ,@body)))
    
    (defmacro gim/--lambda> (&rest body)
      "Expands to a lambda containing the body with `it` bound to the lambda parameter"
      `(lambda (__val734923) (--> __val734923 ,@body)))
  #+end_src

  Ok, now since we are looking things up by name we need the ability to see if two names match. We can just use some chained replacement for now

What remains now is cleanup for example to get rid of the markup with refs. I would actually want to extract that. If no other url exists, this would be a resaonable guess for the proper url

Lets play with this now

Thats right, it parsed the one instance where there actually was a ref, but you know what? At this point I think I'd rather just do it manually already

The illusion that once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed, leading to the belief it has a high frequency of occurrence (a form of selection bias). The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon is the illusion where something that has recently come to one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards. It was named after an incidence of frequency illusion in which the Baader–Meinhof Group was mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning. Also known as current moment bias or present bias, and related to Dynamic inconsistency. A good example of this is a study showed that when making food choices for the coming week, 74% of participants chose fruit, whereas when the food choice was for the current day, 70% chose chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For example, in one study subjects assigned the same probability to the likelihood of obtaining a mean height of above six feet [183 cm] in samples of 10, 100, and 1,000 men. In other words, variation is more likely in smaller samples, but people may not expect this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

* Setup and run Anki Generator
  
  First set up the virtual environment by running the following shell command. I use =pyenv=, but if you have =pipenv= in the global python environment, you don't need the prefix
  
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :dir ./generator :results silent
    (async-shell-command "pyenv exec pipenv install")
  #+end_src

  Ok so then run it I guess 

  #+begin_src shell :dir ./generator 
    pyenv exec pipenv run python generate-anki-from-org.py
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Wrote 90330 bytes to cognitive_biases.apkg

  Opening that up with anki

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
    (async-shell-command "anki ./generator/cognitive_biases.apkg")
  #+end_src


  And that actually works! Yay.

  Next to work on cleanup
