The illusion that once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed, leading to the belief it has a high frequency of occurrence (a form of selection bias).

Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning. Also known as current moment bias or present bias, and related to Dynamic inconsistency. A good example of this is a study showed that when making food choices for the coming week, 74% of participants chose fruit, whereas when the food choice was for the current day, 70% chose chocolate. | 9ba5597a-8922-4a0e-97dd-fbc5286dd5d7 |
   | Insensitivity to sample size       | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size                       | Insensitivity to sample size is a cognitive bias that occurs when people judge the probability of obtaining a sample statistic without respect to the sample size.

In other words, variation is more likely in smaller samples, but people may not expect this.                                                                                                                                                             | b7a6033f-2ff4-446e-b910-ab70c835a514 |

However, when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person, they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors' personality rather than to situational factors.                                                     | 057c8391-5763-42d7-b541-30bf6b5190a4 |

Demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out. This effect shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions, also known as spaced repetition or spaced presentation, than by massed presentation ("cramming").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 9da108df-6da0-4985-b972-eef7a4f80722 |
   | Leveling and sharpening            | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveling_and_sharpening                            | Two functions that are automatic and exist within memory. Sharpening is usually the way people remember small details in the retelling of stories they have experienced or are retelling those stories. Leveling is when people keep out parts of stories and try to tone those stories down so that some parts are excluded. Therefore, it makes it easier to fill in the memory gaps that exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | a0f01745-ff72-4b00-8008-df550a8dd476 |

One participates in argumentum ad baculum when one emphasizes the negative consequences of holding the contrary position, regardless of the contrary position's truth value — particularly when the argument-maker himself causes (or threatens to cause) those negative consequences. It is a special case of the appeal to consequences.                                                                                                                                                          | 486b6f62-2f96-4322-8d14-47bab5ac3eb5 |

   | Inattentional blindness            | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness                            | Also known as perceptual blindness. When an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus in plain sight, purely as a result of a lack of attention rather than any vision defects or deficits. When it becomes impossible to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary "blindness" effect can occur, as individuals fail to see unexpected but often salient objects or stimuli.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 90dcf306-8075-41dc-8a8a-c7a3fd0ee6fd |
   | Attribute substitution             | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution                             | Also known as substitution bias. Occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | e79bf6c1-f999-48fd-a7e7-ae4bec2e77cb |

For example, observers often fail to notice major differences introduced into an image while it flickers off and on again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 13d2cd85-df15-4011-bf90-872b217a4993 |
   
  
* Setup and run Anki Generator
  
  First set up the virtual environment by running the following shell command. I use =pyenv=, but if you have =pipenv= in the global python environment, you don't need the prefix
  
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :dir ./generator :results silent
    (async-shell-command "pyenv exec pipenv install")
  #+end_src

  Ok so then run it I guess 

  #+begin_src shell :dir ./generator 
    pyenv exec pipenv run python generate_anki_from_org.py
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Wrote 151770 bytes to cognitive_biases.apkg


  Opening that up with anki

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
    (async-shell-command "anki ./generator/cognitive_biases.apkg")
  #+end_src


  And that actually works! Yay.

  Next to work on cleanup
