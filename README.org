An [[id:e4001525-d16c-4632-afc9-0813bf574b4b][Anki]] deck to memorize information about cognitive bias

* Plan
Due to my [[id:a3af9090-a8e6-4e7a-9d49-a26d9d220c97][Tech Terms]] Project I should already have the code to go from an org table to an Anki Deck

So where is going to be our data source?

- There is [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg?ref=insanelyusefulwebsites&utm_source=pocket_mylist][this great svg file]]
- But [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases][this wikipedia list looks even better]]

I guess you can actually pull that second one into a buffer and then use [[https://github.com/AdamNiederer/elquery][elquery]] within [[id:3cf50942-d434-4726-b56b-7749839090d7][Emacs]]. 

Though actually maybe even you can do it with [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html][tree-sitter]]

* Playground

  First lets try to open up a buffer and load it with that html
  
  This is interesting, but it results in just the text of the page layed out visually, not html...which is a rather interesting ability
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (eww-browse-url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases")
  (html-mode)
  (rename-buffer "*Cognitive Biases*")
#+end_src


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (require 'request)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Cognitive Bias*")
    (->> (request "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases"
           :sync 't)
         request-response-data
         insert)
    (html-mode))
#+end_src

That's not bad, but tree-sitter just looks like stuff like this

#+begin_quote
        self_closing_tag:
          tag_name:
          attribute:
            attribute_name:
            quoted_attribute_value:
              attribute_value:
          attribute:
            attribute_name:
            quoted_attribute_value:
              attribute_value:
#+end_quote

That can still totally be filtered but surely something else is better

And looks like elquery would even skip that and just let us fetch a parsed three from a url

So how do we do this with that?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'elquery)
  (->> (elquery-read-buffer "*Cognitive Bias*")
       (elquery-$ "h3")
       (nth 15)
       elquery-full-text)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Availability heuristic[edit]

Ok so working off of html is going to suck. There's [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Get_the_contents_of_a_page][some apis available though]]

| Gambler's fallacy                         | the tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the [[law of large numbers]].
